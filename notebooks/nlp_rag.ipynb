      "that  was waiting for it to trigger the action to which it refers. \n",
      "\n",
      "An example of a cue would be \"chest up.\" In contrast, \"lift the chest so that your back gets flat\" is \n",
      "not a cue.  The former can be used after the lifter has assumed the starting position, right before he starts  the \n",

      "explaining key concepts to his athletes over his coaching career.  He will tailor these explanations to fit  the \n",
      "needs of the individuals he is working with and cues will develop. Some cues, like \"chest up,\" are almost \n",
      "universal due to their usefulness, brevity, and sound. It almost barks the correct position at the athlete.  Other \n",
      "cues, like \"Now!\" that appear to be so non-specific as to be useless, are in fact specific to a thing decided \n",
      "upon between coach and lifter, and are extremely individual to that particular situation.  As such, cues must \n",
      "be given in the right circumstances and at exactly the right time, or they are useless and do not cue anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "A cue can also be a reminder that you give yourself.  It will not necessarily be spoken aloud, \n",
      "\n",
      "although this sometimes helps.  It will be the same thing that a coach would say to you under the same \n",

      "brought forward into a position of attention in your mind just before a movement occurs. As you learn the \n",

      "form.  As you become more experienced, you will find it necessary to build cues into your approach to each \n",
      "lift, to solve your own  individual problems with each movement pattern.  You will find that each lift \n",
      "responds to its own reminder, and if you train alone you'll have to remind yourself. \n",
      "\n",
      "You will find that there are two basic types of cues: body cues and bar cues. Body cues are \n",
      "\n",
      "references to your body, like \"chest up,\" \"look forward,\" or \"long, straight arms.\"  They draw awareness to \n",
      "the  thing doing the moving, the muscles or bodyparts that need correction. \n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, bar cues refer to the object being moved.  Examples are \"keep it close,\" \"touch your \n",
      "\n",
      "shirt,\" or \"rattle the plates,\" all referring to the barbell.  A particularly helpful way to use a bar cue is to refer \n",
      "to the speed of the bar as it passes through a certain section of the lift. For instance, if your problem is \n",
      "jerking yourself out of position coming off the floor in a deadlift by getting in a hurry to get the bar moving \n",
      "fast, the cue might be \"pull it slow\" or \"squeeze it up.\" Both cues refer to the bar, and if you do these things \n",
